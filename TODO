TODO
====

First of all, find a prettier name than "nncheck" :)

Implementation
--------------

Bash is cool, but not everybody is able to run bash scripts
(eg. Windows/iPhone/Android user)

Having such a probing tool in Javascript would be fantastic, as it
would allow any mobile device to test its data connection. However,
cocoadaemon has tried to do this, but most browsers block outgoing
connections on certains ports (eg. SMTP, â€¦)

The most reasonable alternative would be to write a python nncheck
(cli and/or GUI). We're also planning an Android application.

Collecting results
------------------

We are considering building a webapp that would collect results from
such tools, see the
[wiki page](https://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Network_Neutrality_checkers_and_aggregation).

More features?
--------------

To properly check for network neutrality violations, probing outgoing
ports is not enough: other violations include transparent proxy, SMTP
server spoofing from the ISP, or any other violation listed on
[Respect My Net](http://respectmynet.eu).

Want to help?
=============

Use IRC, #laquadrature on irc.freenode.net (ask for zorun or cocoadaemon).
