nncheck is a Network Neutrality Checker.

nncheck tries to establish outgoing TCP connections on common ports,
and checks whether they are blocked (for instance, your mobile ISP
could block the SIP port, 5060).

If you find that your ISP (especially a mobile one) is blocking some
ports, you can discuss it on our irc channel, #laquadrature on
irc.freenode.net.

If you live in Europe, you can also visit http://respectmynet.eu :
first check if your country/ISP is already on the list (in which case
you can confirm and comment). If it's not, you can create a new
report.
