About nncheck
=============

nncheck is a Network Neutrality Checker.

nncheck tries to establish outgoing TCP connections on common ports,
and checks whether they are blocked (for instance, your mobile ISP
might block the SIP port, 5060).


Report Net Neutrality violations
================================

If you find that your ISP (especially a mobile one) is blocking some
ports, you can discuss it on our irc channel, #laquadrature on
irc.freenode.net.

If you live in Europe, you can also visit http://respectmynet.eu :
first check if your country/ISP is already on the list (in which case
you can confirm and comment). If it's not, you can create a new
report.


Adding ports to test
====================

Feel free to propose new ports to check!

Please note, though, that each port might take up to 2 seconds to
check (in case the port is blocked but the connection is simply
dropped, not closed -- yeah, some ISPs are evil --, there is a
2-seconds timeout)


Responder
=========

To check whether an outgoing port is blocked, we use La Quadrature du
Net's responder, available at:
  
    http://responder.lqdn.fr:<port> (eg. http://responder.lqdn.fr:6667 )

There also is a text version at:

TODO
====

Bash is cool, but not everybody is able to run bash script
(eg. Windows/iPhone/Android user)

Having such a probing tool in Javascript would be fantastic, as it
would allow any mobile device to test its data connection.

I haven't found such a project yet, probably because it's not easy to
initiate a TCP connection on an arbitrary port in JS.
